# Component decomposition: owners, seams, and where the ground moves

**Date:** 2026-09-13. **Status:** research, executes `specs/02` T2 (capability / exposure /
registration / composition inventory). **Companion:** `2026-09-13-codebase-walk.md` explains the
architecture; this one inventories it.

Two readers, deliberately:

- **the operator**, deciding where officebay's work goes and what it will cost to carry;
- **the agent**, needing to know before an edit who owns a surface, what proves it, and whether
  upstream is about to move it.

Dependents and test coverage come from the CodeGraph index (2,244 files, 29,349 symbols, 147,983
edges), not from grep.

## The churn column, and why it exists

Standard inventories record owner, boundary and tests. This one adds **churn** — evidence that a
surface is about to move underneath us — because we rebase onto squashed upstream snapshots and a
moving surface costs us on every one.

| churn         | meaning                                                                      |

| **declared**  | upstream has published intent to change it (a design note, a "phase 2" list) |
| **contested** | other active forks have edited it heavily, so it is a known conflict magnet  |
| **quiet**     | no evidence of upcoming movement                                             |

## Gap classification for officebay's candidate work

Per `tech.md` §1, classified before any implementation. "Missing agent access is not evidence of a
missing product capability" — two rows below are exactly that trap.

| candidate step                                    | existing owner                               | gap class                | evidence                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slides multi-window / shared session              | `apps/slides/src/main/session-state.ts`      | **exposure**             | the capability is built and running (`scheduleDeckBroadcast` pushes to every attached webContents); the shell has no second window or split view to reach it. Not a capability gap. |
| Structural L1 for math PDFs                       | none                                         | **capability**           | measured: symbols extract cleanly, structure does not. See `2026-09-13-math-extraction-probe.md`.                                                                                   |
| Cross-document / project file access to the agent | `packages/project-store` + shell IPC         | **registration**         | APIs exist; a typed permission-aware tool registration is what is missing.                                                                                                          |
| Long transformation hosting                       | `@picobay/engine`                            | **composition**          | engine exists externally; the missing piece is a host adapter with typed source units and progress/cancellation.                                                                    |
| BYOK-only operation                               | `packages/ai-provider`, `packages/ai-search` | **capability (removal)** | 17 providers already exist; the work is cutting the hosted dependency and fixing the silent fallback. See below.                                                                    |

## Two surfaces that need care before anyone edits them

### The op journal (`apps/slides`)

Upstream shipped `docs/slides-op-journal.md` — an accurate design note, verified against source:
`OpLogEntry` at [session-state.ts:86](../../apps/slides/src/main/session-state.ts#L86), the
200-entry ring, the `journaledTxn` funnel at
[slides-main.ts:1120](../../apps/slides/src/main/slides-main.ts#L1120) with 23 call sites, and a
`reset` marker on snapshot restore.

Its "phase 2" list — ordering authority on a server, content-addressed assets, inverse ops — is a
published statement that `session-state.ts` and `slides-main.ts` **will change**. CodeGraph puts
`runTxn` ([ops/executor.ts:159](../../apps/slides/src/main/ops/executor.ts#L159)) at 9 callers
across 6 test files.

**Rule for officebay:** read from `journaledTxn`, do not modify how it produces. A consumer that
subscribes to applied ops is cheap and rebase-tolerant; anything that changes the production path
conflicts on every snapshot.

One documented gap: the note claims every non-dry `runTxn` goes through `journaledTxn`. The single
exception is transform _preview_ frames at
[slides-main.ts:1381](../../apps/slides/src/main/slides-main.ts#L1381), deliberately unjournaled so
preview gestures do not flood the ring.

### The hosted dependency (`packages/ai-search`, `packages/ai-provider`)

The shipped OSS app is a **client of Genspark's hosted service** in four places: `gsk.ts`
(`genspark.ai/api/tool_cli` for search, image search, slide generation, transcription),
`genoffice-auth.ts` (OAuth device flow, token on disk), `cloud-projects.ts` (project list sync),
and `slides:cloud-page-generate` (server-side deck generation). The README states it plainly:
"Sign in with Genspark and skip keys."

**The trap:** `activeProvider()` at
[providers.ts:274](../../packages/ai-provider/src/providers.ts#L274) falls back to `'genspark'`
whenever a provider config is incomplete — missing model, base URL or key. A half-configured
custom provider appears to work while talking to a different service. Any de-genspark work must fix
this fallback in the same change, and prove it with an egress test — `besliky/airy` ships exactly
such a test (`tools/check-no-genspark.mjs`, Apache-2.0) after removing all four call sites from
their tree, so the removal is demonstrably survivable and the guard is adoptable rather than novel.

## For the agent working here

1. **Enter at a symbol, not a file.** `slides-main.ts` is 179 KB; `apps/pdf/.../App.tsx` is 8,652
   lines. Use `codegraph_explore` — it returns source plus callers plus the tests covering them.
2. **Check the churn column before proposing an edit.** A change in `apps/docs/src/renderer/editor/`
   or `apps/slides/src/main/` needs a justification that survives the next rebase.
3. **Prefer a new `apps/` directory or a new package.** WisWork demonstrated that a new app slots
   into `TabManager` cleanly; that is the cheap path, and `AGENTS.md` already requires it.
4. **Run the proving test named in the table**, not a new one, when touching a format engine. The
   golden files encode byte-preservation guarantees the product advertises.

## Not covered

- Runtime dependency shape between packages (the index has the edges; this pass reports owners).
- `apps/sheets` native sidecar internals (Rust, separate toolchain).
- e2e suite coverage mapping — 35 Playwright specs exist; which journeys they actually prove is
  unmeasured, and is spec 02 T1's job.
